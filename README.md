# Hand-Gesture-Based-Load-Control-OpenCV-Arduino-Python
Hand Gesture-Based Load Control using OpenCV, Python, and Arduino. This project enables real-time gesture recognition to control electrical loads contactlessly. Gestures are processed with OpenCV, commands sent via Python to Arduino, which switches devices using relays for smart automation.
